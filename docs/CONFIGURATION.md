# Configuration Reference

All backend environment variables are declared once in `backend/src/config/registry/`.
This file and `backend/.env.example` are generated from that registry; do not edit them by hand.

## Server

| Variable | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8000` | No | TCP port the backend HTTP server listens on. |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | No | Runtime environment; production enables extra validation and hardening. Allowed: development, production, test. |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | — | No | Comma-separated CORS allowlist of frontend origins; also drives HTTPS detection. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | No | Express trust proxy setting: true, false, or a positive hop count. |

| `UPLOAD_MAX_MB` | `100` | No | Maximum size (in MB) of a single uploaded file accepted by multer (imports, database restores). |
| `BODY_LIMIT_MB` | `50` | No | Maximum request body size (in MB) for scene JSON/urlencoded payloads and the Socket.IO buffer; images no longer travel in the scene body (see FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MB), so this bounds scene JSON only. |
| `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MB` | `100` | No | Maximum size (in MB) of a single image accepted by the raw file-upload endpoint (PUT /api/drawings/:id/files/:fileId); the only per-image cap. |

## Database
